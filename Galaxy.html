    <div class="Scrolltext">A galaxy is a massive, gravitationally bound system comprised of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter.
         These systems can vary greatly in size and structure, ranging from dwarf galaxies with a few thousand stars to supergiant galaxies with hundreds of trillions.
         Galaxies are fundamental components of the universe, with the observable universe estimated to contain trillions. </div>
